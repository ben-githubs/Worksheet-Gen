\jblock{block problem}
    Explain why \jvar{wrong_ans}! isn't the total number of \jvar{word | length}-letter arrangements that can be made from the word \jvar{word | upper}. Determine the actual number of \jvar{word | length}-letter arrangements.

\jblock{block solution}
    When a word has multiple instances of the same letter, the number of unique arrangements must account for these letters being interchanged.

    By default, the number of arrangements of an N-letter word are N!. For words with repeated letters, we must divide this result by the number of arrangements of each set of repeated letters.
    Thus, the answer is $\frac{\jvar{wrong_ans}!}{\jblock{for x in multiples} \jvar{x}! \jblock{endfor}}$.
